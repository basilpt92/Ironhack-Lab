LEFT JOIN  category b ON a.category_id = b.category_id
GROUP BY name;

-- 2. Which actor has appeared in the most films?

SELECT CONCAT(b.first_name, " ",b.last_name) AS customer_name, COUNT(rental_id) AS number_of_rentals
FROM rental a LEFT JOIN customer b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY number_of_rentals DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 4. List number of films per category.

-- 8. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. 
-- List the customers alphabetically by last name. Bonus: Which is the most rented film?

FROM payment a
LEFT JOIN customer b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
