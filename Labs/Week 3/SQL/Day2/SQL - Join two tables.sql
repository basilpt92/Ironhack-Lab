-- 1.How many films are there for each of the categories in the category table. Use appropriate join to write this query
SELECT b.name as category_name, COUNT(a.film_id) as number_of_films 
FROM film_category a
LEFT JOIN  category b ON a.category_id = b.category_id
GROUP BY name;

-- 2. Which actor has appeared in the most films?

FROM film_actor a
LEFT JOIN actor b ON a.actor_id = b.actor_id
GROUP BY actor_name
ORDER BY number_of_films DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 3. Most active customer (the customer that has rented the most number of films)
SELECT CONCAT(b.first_name, " ",b.last_name) AS customer_name, COUNT(rental_id) AS number_of_rentals
FROM rental a LEFT JOIN customer b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY number_of_rentals DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 4. List number of films per category.

SELECT DISTINCT a.first_name, a.last_name, b.address, b.district, c.city
FROM staff a
LEFT JOIN address b ON a.address_id = b.address_id
LEFT JOIN city c´ ON b.city_id = c.city_id;
    
-- 6.Display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005.
SELECT CONCAT(b.first_name, " ", b.last_name) AS staff_member, SUM(a.amount) AS rung_up_amount

-- 8. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. 
-- List the customers alphabetically by last name. Bonus: Which is the most rented film?

FROM payment a
LEFT JOIN customer b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY customer;
